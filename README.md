Overview
This notebook demonstrates:

Data generation: A custom function to generate a 2-class spiral dataset using polar coordinates.
Visualization: Using Matplotlib to visualize the generated dataset in 2D space.
Neural network: A basic setup for using this dataset in a neural network (future steps to implement the classifier).
The dataset is widely used in machine learning as it presents a non-linearly separable problem, making it an interesting use case for training neural networks.

Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. You can either run it locally or in an environment like Google Colab.

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solid-broccoli-AI.git
cd solid-broccoli-AI
Install dependencies: You can install the required packages via pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
If you are running the code in Google Colab, the dependencies should already be available.

Usage
You can use the provided Jupyter notebook to generate the dataset and visualize it. Here's how to do it:

Load the notebook: Open the notebook 2_class_spiral_dataset_for_nn.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab.

Run the notebook: Run the cells in sequence to generate and visualize the 2-class spiral dataset.

Neural Network (optional): In the future, you can integrate a neural network classifier to classify the dataset. This is a non-linearly separable problem, so it's perfect for testing deep learning models like MLPs or CNNs.

Results
The generated dataset consists of two spirals in 2D space. Each spiral represents one class (red or blue). The plot provides a visualization of the complexity of separating these two classes.

You can experiment by tweaking:

Number of data points.
Radius of the spirals.
Amount of noise in the data.
Below is a sample visualization:


Technologies Used
