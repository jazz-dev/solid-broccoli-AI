## Overview
This notebook demonstrates:

- **Data generation**: A custom function to generate a 2-class spiral dataset using polar coordinates.
- **Visualization**: Using Matplotlib to visualize the generated dataset in 2D space.
- **Neural network**: A basic setup for using this dataset in a neural network (future steps to implement the classifier).
  
The dataset is widely used in machine learning as it presents a non-linearly separable problem, making it an interesting use case for training neural networks.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. You can either run it locally or in an environment like Google Colab.

### Clone the repository:

```bash
